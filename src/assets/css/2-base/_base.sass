/*
	This file is used to define our projects base styles. This refers to any reset styles that are specific to this project such as typography presets (applying our font choices to headings and paragraphs, as well as specifying sizes etc), body styling, applying padding/margin to specific elements etc.

	I have included a sample base stylesheet using the font we selected in the _fonts.scss file, and specified some other styles I like to use within my projects as a starting point! By each style i've included a brief comment explaining its purpose and added some suggestions towards better values that are dependant on the type of project.
